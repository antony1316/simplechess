simplechess
===========

Video game made using Android basic graphics and SDK libraries.
This was a course project. It was required that the app contain basic graphics, a response to a tap, and a response to dragging.

This is a 2-player game.
Tapping a piece displays legal moves as well as pieces that can be taken.
Dragging a piece moves the selected piece around the board.
The game does not contain all chess rules as of yet.
